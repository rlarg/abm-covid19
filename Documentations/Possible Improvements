This is a place for random ideas that i think of that could improve the script

1. Different movement modes, e.g complete randomness, or directed home-to-work movement
2. Cells to represent a hospital where the odds of recovery are higher, hospitals can have capacities
3. Maybe consider that people can be in the same cell, where they are very close so odds are higher
4. There should be a decicded scale for distances, so we can emulate the distancing rule.
5. There should be randomized stats for an agent that increases/decreses risk. E.g an agent can have a random weight (maybe that follows national stats) and that relates to their risk to covid
6. There are numerous human traits we could take into account, such as if they wear a mask, if they choose not to go outside, or if they are very active outside
